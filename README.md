An application for reading poetry by authors of depth without having to pay for a premium plan to be able to do anything.

It is, however, an educational project that will most likely not be followed for much longer and updated continuously.

In fact, this is one of my first applications written in Flutter, and therefore poorly optimised and written in all likelihood: that is why there is no point in trying to update it continuously, but it would make more sense to redo it from scratch in the future with more experience.

If you would still like to try it out out of curiosity, I will release the apk once it is done.
